			<p>Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza cut a despondent figure at the post-match press conference after the series-levelling 70-run loss at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground yesterday. The loss of the opportunity to win a first-ever series against Sri Lanka and a rare away series was disappointing enough, but it must have been doubly disappointing to have lost the match after feeling at the halfway point that they had done what he said before the match was required to get across the line.

Before the third ODI between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the winner of the toss had lost the match 28 out of 52 times.
